OE tires are those that come pre-installed on vehicles directly from the manufacturer. These tires are designed specifically to meet the performance, safety, and durability standards of the vehicle model. The demand for OE premium tires is closely tied to vehicle production rates, with manufacturers focusing on tires that offer superior traction, handling, and comfort. As the automotive industry increasingly embraces high-performance vehicles, the market for OE premium tires is expected to grow, driven by both consumer preferences for advanced technologies and automakers' desire to meet regulatory standards for fuel efficiency and safety.

Replacement premium tires, on the other hand, are purchased after the original tires wear out and need to be replaced. These tires cater to consumers looking for high-quality, durable, and performance-oriented options that enhance driving experiences. The replacement tire segment in Germany is driven by factors such as vehicle age, consumer preferences for quality, and the growing trend of maintenance-oriented vehicle ownership. With a focus on safety, comfort, and performance, premium replacement tires are increasingly popular among consumers who prioritize longevity and superior road handling. The rise in demand for electric vehicles (EVs) also contributes to the growth of this segment, as premium tires are designed to accommodate the unique driving characteristics of EVs.
